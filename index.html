        <p class="narrow"><b>After our experience, what advice would I give to others wanting to travel to Norway?   </b>  </p>
          
        <p class="narrow">First, visiting both Oslo and Bergen, is a must if it’s your first visit.  
        	I wished we had one more day in Oslo, because there is plenty to do and see in the capital.    </p>
                        
          
        <p class="narrow">After visiting the “big cities”, plan at least one adventure to a smaller village, a fjord, 
        	or a more remote area.  We chose to spend a day and night at Balestrand on a fjord; I just wished 
        	we had spent more time there.      </p>
          
        <p class="narrow">If you want to explore a more remote area, I highly recommend the Lofoten Islands – they were magical, and the next time we visit Norway, 
        	I would like to spend 4 to 5 days exploring this area. Just don’t do what we did – we started and ended in Harstad, which was just too far away, 
        	and also was a rather boring city.  Instead, fly directly into Svolvaer, which has car rentals; this will save you time.  Another option is to 
        	fly into Bodø, rent a car and take the ferry across to the Lofoten Islands.      </p>
                        
          
        <p class="narrow">If you have relatives, even distant relatives, make a point to visit them, even if it’s just for a quick coffee.  They can give you 
        	the local perspective and help you with your plans. We were fortunate to have relatives that my mother is close to, so it was easier to arrange the 
        	encounters.  The visits with our relatives were really the highlight of the trip.     </p>
          
        <p class="narrow"><b>And now, advice about the challenges of visiting Norway: </b>    </p>
                        
          
        <p class="narrow">First, you need to plan far ahead, for everything.  Summer is a very busy tourist season, and hotels, AirBnb’s, trains, planes, 
        	boats – are quickly sold out.  And be prepared to be inundated by tourists.  We seldom experienced the crowd of tourists, partly because we 
        	went early to museums, and managed to adjust our tourist times.  Bergen can get several (up to 10!) cruise ships docked at once, so it can be 
        	crowded, but mostly in the downtown Brygenn wharf area  and the funicular.      </p>
          
        <p class="narrow">Costs issues – yes Norway can be expensive.  We found hotels to be reasonably priced – and they all offer free big breakfasts.  
        	Eating out at restaurants is expensive.  However, you have to account for the fact that the taxes are included in the pricing, and there is 
        	really no tipping done, except a small amount at nicer restaurants.  So when considering restaurant prices, take off 20%  or more to match 
        	US costs.  Drinks, especially alcohol, are very expensive.  If you minimize this, you can save on costs.    </p>
       
       <p class="narrow">Should you use cash or credit cards? Not once did we use cash, or use an ATM to extract cash. Everyplace in Norway uses credit 
       		cards, even the street merchants. We were advised at our first hotel, to just use credit cards, and it worked for us, even in the more
       		remote areas.  	 </p>
       		
       <p class="narrow">Renting a car in Norway can be very expensive. We needed a car to explore Andøya and the Lofoten Islands, so we had 
       	    little choice.  You have to "pay to play".   	 </p>
