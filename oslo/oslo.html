  	<h2>Oslo City Experience</h2>
    <p class="narrow">We started our trip in Oslo, the Capital of Norway, and spent 3 incredible days in this beautiful city, visiting museums, relatives, parks, 
    	and just enjoyed experiencing the city a a leisurely pace. </p>
    	
        <figure>
          <img src="images/oslomap.jpg" alt="Map: Oslo " style="float:left;width:928px;height:491px; margin:1rem"> 
        </figure>    	
    	
    <p class="narrow">Oslo, the capital of Norway, sits on the country’s southern coast at the head of the Oslofjord. 
    	It’s known for its green spaces and museums. Many of these are on the Bygdøy Peninsula, including the Folk Museum, 
    	the Norwegian Maritime Museum, and the Viking Ship Museum, with Viking ships from the 9th century.
    </p>		
    	
    <p class="narrow">
    	We bought a one-day Oslo Pass, which gives access to most museums, boats, and trams. It was definitely worth the cost! We took advantage of the pass, 
    	and took the boat from the Aker Brygge waterfront to the Bygdøy Peninsula, to visit the Folk Museum, 
    	the Viking Ship Museum, the Norwegian Maritime Museum, and even the wierd Kon-Tiki Museum. Although we were tired, we then headed back to the waterfront, 
    	and took in the Akershus Castle and the Nazi Resistance Museum - both of which were our favorite places that we highly recommend! SIX museums
    	in one day was plenty! </p>
   <p class="narrow">The next day we took the tram to the Vineland Sculpture Park (which is free).  This is a must see - we just enjoyed walking through the beautiful park
   		with the incredible scuplures by Vineland. We also spent hours on the waterfront just enjoying the scenery and restaurants - and people watching.  
   		This was the Oslo's first hot sunny weather - and the natives went crazy soaking up the sun.  Another recommendation is to go into the Oslo City Hall, which 
   		is right on the waterfront, and take the free half-hour tour.  It's a unique building, and is used to award the Nobel Prizes.   </p>
   		<p class="narrow">What didn't we get to see that I wish we had?  We didn't get to see the Opera House which is highly recommended.  And, we didn't get
   			to the Holmenkollbakken, which Norway's premier ski-jumping hill with panoramic views of the fjord. </p>
   <p class="narrow">The highlight of our Oslo experience had to be the visit with some of our Oslo relatives. All the relatives we met on this trip, are from my 
   		mother's side, and most of the relatives are cousins that she has known throughout her life.  Meeting these relatives was a special treat that made
   		the trip an even better experience.  </p>
    <p class="narrow">Another great treat was staying at the Thon Hotel on Rosenkrantz.  The location was perfect, and the food was fabulous!  This hotel 
    	had the best breakfast spread we have ever experienced, and, also had a "light dinner" - which was also good. The meals are included in price - so 
    	we saved a lot by eating at the hotel.  If you go to Oslo, we highly recommend this hotel.     </p>
